# Predictive-Analysis-Project

The Data Warehouse created in the first project [ACME-Flying-Data-Warehousing-Project](https://github.com/0J0P0/Data-Warehousing-Project) is meant to support business intelligence (descriptive analysis via OLAP), reporting, and data analysis. As a continuation, in this project, you are tasked with developing an analytical pipeline for predicting if an aircraft is going to interrupt its operation unexpectedly in the next seven days (i.e., a predictive analysis). In the AMOS database, there exists a table called Operation Interruption, which reports about past events. The aim of this project is to predict (and avoid happening) potential future occurrences in this table.
